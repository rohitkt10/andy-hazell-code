	indices for a vehicle moving on a rough surface with preview of the

	optimal tracking theory and consequently the system elements are
	taken to be linear and the performance index is constrained to be
	of quadratic form. The ideas of overtaking optimality are applied
	to the problem in order to achieve a closed form solution for the
	control. Then, using the control laws derived, computer simulations
	of performance are conducted and time histories are shown. In the
	absence of limitations on either processing or actuator speeds, and
	for cases in which the preview is sufficient to give good control
	laws, the value of the preview in enhancing vehicle suspension performance
	is assessed. Comparisons are made with results in the literature.},

	Gaussian problem by augmenting dynamics of the original system and
	previewed road inputs. The resulting solution is a combination of

	The optimal estimator takes the form of a Kalman filter with an additional

	preview sensor signal. The Kalman filter gain and the weight used
	for estimating state and road input, respectively, are designed so
	that performance degradation by measurement noise is minimized. Numerical
	examples of a quarter car model are given to verify the performance
	improvement achievable with the proposed preview control when the
