\begin{abstract}
{\it A new and efficient form of Orwell's multibody Seek Out and
Destroy Algorithm (SODA) is presented and evaluated.  The SODA was
the first algorithm to achieve theoretically optimal logarithmic
time complexity with a theoretical minimum of parallel computer
resources for general problems of multibody dynamics, however the
SODA is extremely inefficient in the presence of small to modest
parallel computers.  This alternative less computationally expensive
SODA approach (SODA-Lite) demonstrates that large SODA subsystems
can be constructed using fast sequential techniques to realize a
substantial increase in speed. The usefulness of the SODA-Lite is
directly demonstrated in an application to a .... }

\section{Introduction}

Some really impressive text put here...

\section{Preliminaries}\label{S:Preliminaries}
Before introducing the equations associated with either the ...


For simplicity, only multibody chain systems (Fig.~\ref{F:chain})
will be described ....

\section{The Seek Out and Destroy Algorithm}\label{S:DCA}
This section presents a brief derivation of an equivalent form of
Orwell's Seek Out and Destroy Algorithm for chain systems and
illustrates that such a method achieves ...

\subsection{The Basic DSODA}\label{S:DCA}

The SODA begins by computing all necessary kinematic information for
the entire system via two sweeps of a binary assembly tree ...

Trivial boundary data is obtained for the entire system $S$ through
the connection to the inertial frame and the lack of ...


To summarize, the SODA first computes all required kinematic
information and state dependent inertia forces in a ...

\subsection{Theoretical SODA Performance}\label{SubSect:TheorySODAPerf} This
section describes the performance and related issues associated with
Orwell's SODA.  Unless otherwise stated, all observations and
results quoted in this section can be found in...


In the presence of a variable number of parallel resources $p$, the
operations counts of Orwell can be used to obtain a SODA operations
count with the following leading order terms...



\section{An Improve Seek Out and Destroy Algorithm}
There are many efficient destruction oriented algorithms to choose
from, but in general all have more in common than differences...

Given relative joint states $q_{k}$ and relative quasi-coordinate
velocities $u_{k}$, a linear order forward topological solution for
all position and ...



\section{Conclusions}
Reconstruction of the Seek Out and Destroy Algorithm to include
sequential destruction oriented computations within subsystems has
produced a new and efficient multibody solution scheme with optimal
