====
- chnage thesis reference to inlucde link -->done
- add to google code-->done
- Design insights: Merge changes from thesis --> done
- Is the trace formula (eqn 3) in need of squaring? -->done
- FI : correct 2-norm sum error --> done
- H2norm: 
	-Merge most changes from thesis, but don't include example. -->done
	-Add gam_%,imp definition and associated paras -->done
	-Consider moving section intro to the main intro. -->?
- Simple example: merge changes from thesis -> done 
- Feedforward solution: copy intro paras from thesis --> done 
- Output feedback and efficient implementation: no changes
- Conclusions
	- Add reference to Preview control toolbox
	- Major re-writing of conclusions to emphasise contribution. The statement that "The purpose of the present work
is to embed a class of preview control problems in a generalized regulator
configuration" is quite misleading I think. This is purely a means to an end, not the end in itself. 
- Add reference to examples in thesis
